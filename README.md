# SEPML
Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) forecasting with machine learning framework

Current physics based models of SEPs are unable to execute sufficiently fast in order to provide actionable information towards forecasting such disturbances, which can impact Earth within tens of minutes of the onset of an eruptive event. This is compounded by the intrinsic latency of certain key observations, which are used to define the initial conditions of these models. Instead, there is a reliance on statistical models to provide forecast probabilities of Earth-bound SEPs using real-time data. Since the largest, most impactful events occur infrequently, some regions of the feature space are sparse and simple discrete binning procedures have limitations. The goal of this project is to improve upon the empirical SEP proton prediction forecast model (PROTONS) currently in operational use at SWPC, through the application of modern machine learning techniques.
